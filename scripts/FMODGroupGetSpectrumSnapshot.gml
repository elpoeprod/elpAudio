//export double FMODGroupGetSpectrumSnapshot(double group, double channel, double size, LPSTR Buffer)

//Group is the sound group, 0 Master, 1- priority, 2 Effect, 3 Ambiant Music, 4 Ambiant effects
//Channel is the sound channel (FMODSoundGetNumChannels to figure how many channels you need to fetch)
//It's usually good enough to get channel 0 (for mono sounds or left channel for stereo sounds) 1 is right, 2 and higher are the other channels if any
//size is the size of the buffer... keep it 2^n 32,64,128.... 1024 (max)

//Each character is a value from 0to 255 to represent the spectrum played 
//buffer = FMODGroupGetSpectrumSnapshot(instance,0, 256)
//Use ord(string_char_at(buffer,<<1 to size>>)) to access values
//If you need to average left and right channels create a more accurate display of both channels in one screen 
//you will need to call this twice (with 0 then with 1) then loop through each value, add them together and divide by 2
//The demo draws both left and right individually
//NOTE for drawing... If the sound is 41000 or 48000, consider asking for 256 bytes but display only the first 128
//like the demo does...That will draw frequencies 0 to 22KHz, the commun hearing frequencies

//The function normalises the values... That is the highest value will always be 255... 
//This ensures your will get the maximum range possible. Done in the Dll this is faster 
//than GM would do it with strings. Since I figure most poeple will want this on default...
//However, the retun call of the DLL function returns the max value and I stuff it in a member
//variable FMODMaxV so you may un-normalize the data if you need to using
//ord(string_char_at(buffer,<<1 to size>>))*FMODMaxV
